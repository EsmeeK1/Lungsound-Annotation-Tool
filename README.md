# README - Lungsound Annotation Tool

## Credits

The original **Tkinter app** (included in the `experiments` folder of this repository) is derived from the following project:
[https://github.com/rediet-getnet/ECG-Signal-Viewer-and-Annotation-Tool](https://github.com/rediet-getnet/ECG-Signal-Viewer-and-Annotation-Tool)

Full credit goes to the original author for building this version.

Even though this app isn't made for ECG's but Lungsounds. The blueprint of the app is still derived from that original TKinter app.
