    "# Introduction: Band-Pass Filtering for Lung Sound Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to apply a Butterworth band-pass filter to lung sound recordings using Python.\n",
    "Band-pass filtering is a common preprocessing step in biomedical signal analysis, used to remove very low and very high frequency noise and keep only the relevant frequency range of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* `fc = (low_cut, high_cut):`\n",
    "Defines the frequency range (in Hz) that passes through the filter.\n",
    "For example, `fc = (50, 100)` keeps frequencies between 50 Hz and 100 Hz. Which would be used for heartsounds, but not for lungsounds. The range for that would be between 80 - 3000Hz for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `order:`\n",
    "Determines how steep the filter’s roll-off is. A higher order gives stronger attenuation outside the passband.\n",
    "Here we use `order = 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `zero_phase:`\n",
    "If `True`, the filter is applied forward and backward using `sosfiltfilt`, which cancels any phase distortion (zero group delay).\n",
    "This makes the filtered signal better aligned in time with the original waveform — important for lung sound analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load a lung sound signal x (e.g. from a .wav file).\n",
    "2. Apply the filter:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    y = bandpass_filter(x, Fs, fc=(50, 100), order=2, zero_phase=True)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Optionally, visualize x and y to see the filtering effect, or compute spectral differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example serves as a compact demonstration of how filtering can improve signal clarity."
