# README â€“ ECG Viewer (Tkinter Prototype)

## Introduction
This project is a **prototype ECG Viewer and Annotation Tool** built with **Tkinter** and **Matplotlib** inside a Jupyter Notebook.

It was created as a simpler starting point for ECG visualization and labeling before moving to a faster PySide6 + PyQtGraph implementation.
